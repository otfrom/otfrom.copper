# otfrom.copper

A little bit of messing around with io and pipeline as I try to figure
out what I want to do with annoying size data. When I understand what
is going on I'll probably create a kixi.copper for all my pipe needs.

It was the article from @malcolmsparks, help from @acron0 and cheering
from @mantree at the @MastodonC hack time organised by @Eleonore9 and
@seb231.
